# How I plan of getting a 5

## Program Purpose and Function

I'll need to have a strong understanding of my actions in order to get this point. To accomplish this, I must stop whenever I find myself typing code that I do not fully comprehend and attempt to understand its meaning before continuing. I can take notes on College Board videos, as Bria mentioned, and if I need more help, I can watch Khan Academy, which has a ton of more information.

## Data Abstraction

In order to complete the two code segments to the best of my ability, it will be essential that I put a lot of time and attention into this project. My code must function flawlessly and be aesthetically pleasing for the viewers.

## Managing Complexity and Procedural Abstraction

I need to establish the practice of doing more when I code rather than just the minimum level. I often have self-doubt because I'm a beginner coder, but I need to step outside of my comfort zone and begin experimenting with more complex code and hacks. Instead of settling for 2.7 points on the weekly grade, I can start by shooting for 2.7+.

## Algorithm Implementation

I must learn how to write my code more effectively.  I will become more proficient at using algorithms and as a result, allowing the computer to perform more tasks for me. 

## Testing

I can get better at this by starting to write posts that describe my code and what it accomplishes. By doing this, I will be able to clearly explain code so that the person evaluating my assignment will be able to tell that I know what I am talking about.

## Possible Ideas

I am not completely sure what my project is going to be, but I know that I want to to be fun and educational at the same time.
