You will fill in at least two strategies in each category, describe how the strategy is used, and detail why the speaker would employ such a strategy.

**<span class="underline">Closing Questions:</span>**

1.  > Who is Gandhi’s audience? How did you decide on that audience? Name specific moments in her talk that indicate her audience.

Gandhi’s audience is people who listen to modern music. I decided this to be her audience because she calls out modern music and says that the lyrics are oppressive and there should be a change. She brings up when she works out the music she listens to that hypes her up, but when she actually looked at the lyrics, she realized that the lyrics are oppressing. This made her want to make upbeat music to hype one up, while having the lyrics be in a positive manner.

2.  > Suggest two additional strategies that you feel Gandhi should or could have included in her speech to make it stronger.

<!-- end list -->

  - > Examples of the negative lyrics that she says is oppressing to others

  - > Give other examples of people who use uplifting lyrics in order to promote those types of artists who made the change like she did

<!-- end list -->

3.  > Why would the strategies you suggest above improve the quality of her presentation? When describing the value of each strategy, make specific connections to how these strategies may help her speech as a whole.

The strategy of using examples of negative lyrics would help improve her argument and presentation because she can show her audience what lyrics are actually being said to further prove her point. This can be incorporated after she was talking about her workout experience that she listened to music with oppressing lyrics. Giving other examples of people with uplifting lyrics can help promote others who are fighting against the same cause as her. This will allow many people to expand their music horizon of positive lyrics. She could put this after the sample of her song so that people can see other options of music with similar lyrics and meaning as hers.
