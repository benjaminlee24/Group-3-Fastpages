**[Kobe Bryant Quiz](https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/eXy_yOmPrXgG1G-CnEAlxFo-5pTv3VZRFwShlB8mvdA/edit)**

# Planning

I planned to make two quizzes in one about Kobe using AppLab on code.org. I will have an easy quiz and a hard quiz that both have 3 questions with 4 multiple choice answers. After every question it will tell you if you got the question right or wrong and display your score at the end of the quiz.

# Successes

Both of the quizzes that provided immediate feedback on whether the user answered a question correctly or incorrectly were ones that I was able to implement. The user could retake the quiz as many times as they wanted after finishing it, and all of the questions worked without a problem.

# Challenges

One issue I had was that I couldn't get the quiz's final result to show up. This was the only aspect of my original plan that I was unable to complete. While creating the quiz, I encountered more issues, such as buttons that led to the incorrect screen because I had mislabeled them. It took me some time to identify which buttons had incorrect labels and to change them to the correct ones.

# Discoveries

I hadÂ no prior experience with AppLab or Code.org before this assignment. I feel a great amount more comfortable using the software now that I've created the quiz and worked through a few problems. Although I recognize that this is basic difficulty, it will probably help me advance in my computer science career.
