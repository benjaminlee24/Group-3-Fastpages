Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage. 3.Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale. 4.Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. 5.Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done. 6.The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation. 7.Working software is the primary measure of progress. 8.Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. 9.Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. 10.Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential. 11.The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams. 12.At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly. .",

Some of the ideas that I think will be the most helpful for me are making time for things other than work and importance of getting proper sleep. . Making time: Santos speaks on how nowadays people get so caught up in work that they don’t spend time doing anything else. She explained how this is very bad for our health and we need to make time for other things. I can incorporate this in my life my setting a schedule every week for when I will hangout with my friends and go to the gym so I don’t end up spending my entire day doing homework. . Sleep: Santos talked about the importance of sleep and how a lack of sleep can greatly affect a persons happiness. She mentioned a statistic of highschool students getting an average of around 4 hours of sleep per night which is far from the recommended 8 hours. I can ensure that I get a good nights sleep every night by setting an alarm on my phone to go to bed at a certain time every night. . What My Partner Nico Learned . In the video “Psychology and the Good Life” by Laurie Santos I was able to learn about on how to improve my quality of life and just how to become happier overall. The main takeaways I got from the video was the importance of expressing gratitude and helping others. . Expressing Gratitude: Santos stressed the importance of being grateful for all the great things we have in life. She explained how doing has proven to make people happier through several studies. I can incorporate this into my life my sitting down for 20 minutes with no distractions and writing out all the things I am grateful for. . Helping Others: Santos described an experiment in which people were given 5 dollars and some kept the money and spent on themselves while others gave it to others. It was found that the ones who gave the money away were significantly more satisfied. This shows that in helping others you are indirectly helping your own happiness. I can incorporate this in my life by making sure to do a random act of kindness week such as giving a homeless person money. . What Our Group Learned . .",

            "content": "How I plan of getting a 5 . Program Purpose and Function . I’ll need to have a strong understanding of my actions in order to get this point. To accomplish this, I must stop whenever I find myself typing code that I do not fully comprehend and attempt to understand its meaning before continuing. I can take notes on College Board videos, as Bria mentioned, and if I need more help, I can watch Khan Academy, which has a ton of more information. . Data Abstraction . In order to complete the two code segments to the best of my ability, it will be essential that I put a lot of time and attention into this project. My code must function flawlessly and be aesthetically pleasing for the viewers. . Managing Complexity and Procedural Abstraction . I need to establish the practice of doing more when I code rather than just the minimum level. I often have self-doubt because I’m a beginner coder, but I need to step outside of my comfort zone and begin experimenting with more complex code and hacks. Instead of settling for 2.7 points on the weekly grade, I can start by shooting for 2.7+. . Algorithm Implementation . I must learn how to write my code more effectively.  I will become more proficient at using algorithms and as a result, allowing the computer to perform more tasks for me.  . Testing . I can get better at this by starting to write posts that describe my code and what it accomplishes. By doing this, I will be able to clearly explain code so that the person evaluating my assignment will be able to tell that I know what I am talking about. . Possible Ideas . I am not completely sure what my project is going to be, but I know that I want to to be fun and educational at the same time. .",

I will have an easy quiz and a hard quiz that both have 3 questions with 4 multiple choice answers. After every question it will tell you if you got the question right or wrong and display your score at the end of the quiz. . Successes . Both of the quizzes that provided immediate feedback on whether the user answered a question correctly or incorrectly were ones that I was able to implement. The user could retake the quiz as many times as they wanted after finishing it, and all of the questions worked without a problem. . Challenges . One issue I had was that I couldn’t get the quiz’s final result to show up. This was the only aspect of my original plan that I was unable to complete. While creating the quiz, I encountered more issues, such as buttons that led to the incorrect screen because I had mislabeled them. It took me some time to identify which buttons had incorrect labels and to change them to the correct ones. . Discoveries . I had no prior experience with AppLab or Code.org before this assignment. I feel a great amount more comfortable using the software now that I’ve created the quiz and worked through a few problems. Although I recognize that this is basic difficulty, it will probably help me advance in my computer science career. .",

Directions: In this assignment, we are looking for you to identify the rhetorical strategies used by the speaker in the video. You will fill in at least two strategies in each category, describe how the strategy is used, and detail why the speaker would employ such a strategy. . Example: (Ethos) Gandhi immediately uses high level vocabulary (academic language). This language establishes her as a credible speaker with a strong academic background. It conditions the audience to trust her larger claims that she makes deeper in the speech. . Logos: . Strategy: Research study of 2.6% identify as a women (no citation) . How/Why It’s Used: Used to show that women are being oppressed and to show not many people in the music industry are women. . Strategy: She calls out the problem of oppressing lyrics and then plays a song that is the opposite of the problem. . How/Why It’s Used: She does this to organize her speech and make it flow to help move her point across. . Ethos: . Strategy: When she said she also makes music . How/Why It’s Used: Used to show that she has credibility in the music industry as she is an artist and musician herself. . Strategy: Her song that she performed a little of . How/Why It’s Used: Has the credibility of what she’s talking about because she made a song to prove so. . Pathos: . Strategy: Passionate hand motions and volume and tone of her voice . How/Why It’s Used: To show her passion about the topic and express her emotions. . Strategy: The word choice that she uses is very specific . How/Why It’s Used: The word choice she uses about the pronouns shows how passionate she is about it and appeals to people’s emotions. . Closing Questions: . Who is Gandhi’s audience? How did you decide on that audience? Name specific moments in her talk that indicate her audience. . | Gandhi’s audience is people who listen to modern music. I decided this to be her audience because she calls out modern music and says that the lyrics are oppressive and there should be a change. She brings up when she works out the music she listens to that hypes her up, but when she actually looked at the lyrics, she realized that the lyrics are oppressing. This made her want to make upbeat music to hype one up, while having the lyrics be in a positive manner. . Suggest two additional strategies that you feel Gandhi should or could have included in her speech to make it stronger. . | Examples of the negative lyrics that she says is oppressing to others . | Give other examples of people who use uplifting lyrics in order to promote those types of artists who made the change like she did . | . Why would the strategies you suggest above improve the quality of her presentation? When describing the value of each strategy, make specific connections to how these strategies may help her speech as a whole. . | The strategy of using examples of negative lyrics would help improve her argument and presentation because she can show her audience what lyrics are actually being said to further prove her point. This can be incorporated after she was talking about her workout experience that she listened to music with oppressing lyrics.

This will allow many people to expand their music horizon of positive lyrics. She could put this after the sample of her song so that people can see other options of music with similar lyrics and meaning as hers. .",
